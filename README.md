# React email client
This is just a simple email client that I created with React, Node/Express, and a PostgreSQL database.

## Instructions for local setup:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies: run `yarn` in main project directory and also client directory.
3. Set up database: run `yarn db`.
4. Run the app: `yarn dev`.
